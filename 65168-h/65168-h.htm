</div>
<p>The Pioneer Home, which serves as an Information Center for
Carillon Park, is believed to have been built about 1815.</p>
<p>It was originally located in Washington Township about five miles
southwest of Centerville on Social Row Road, about halfway between
Sheehan Road and Yankee Street. In the spring of 1953 it was torn down
and moved to Carillon Park, where it was rebuilt, using the original
stones and timbers.</p>
<p>Abstract records in the Court House show that the 20-acre plot on
which this house was originally located was sold by Abner and Patsy
Garrard on February 14, 1815, to William Morris and his wife. The
purchase price was $140. Later records show that the Morrises sold
the property on September 18, 1838, for $753. The difference in the
purchase and selling prices was the largest in over 50 years and indicates
that the house was built sometime during that 23-year period.</p>
<p>Since 1858 the property has had a number of owners, including an
Elizabeth Morris, who bought it in 1856 and lived there for 30 years.
Whether she was related to the builder of the house is not known. In
1896 the property was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Hugh E. Brunk, who
lived in the house until 1907.</p>
<p>Most houses built in the early 1800&rsquo;s were made of logs and chinked
with plaster made of lime and sand. This house was built of a good
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
quality white limestone, the reason probably being that stone was easier
to obtain than logs in this particular location, because a stone quarry was
located scarcely a quarter-mile away. The old quarry, near Sheehan
Road, long since has been abandoned.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" id="ncfig3" alt="Pioneers and Conestoga wagon" width="800" height="419" />
</div>
<p>The stone walls of the house were about 18 inches thick and the
inside surface of these walls was plastered. The whole interior of
the downstairs rooms, except the floors, was whitewashed. The interior
dimensions of the lower floor are 15 by 23 feet.</p>
<p>Floor joists, rafters, and shingle laths were all hand hewn from white
oak. Examination of the floor joists disclosed that four of them had been
split from the same log. All wooden trim and the door and window
frames were of black walnut. In the period when this house was built,
the use of this kind of wood was not at all uncommon even in barns.</p>
<p>The floor boards were about one and a quarter inches thick and were
of beech and walnut. There is no ridge pole to support the roof, but
the rafters are notched and put together with wooden pins. The split
shingles were of oak. In the work of reconstruction, all of the stone used
is the original stone except the floor, which formerly was of wood. The
ceiling beams, attic flooring, rafters and most of the shingle laths are
originals. The remaining woodwork which was in bad condition has
been replaced but the original details of design and construction have
been carefully reproduced.</p>
<p>The fireplace chimneys are a part of the end walls. This style
of architecture shows the Moravian influence, the Moravians being a
religious sect who came to Ohio mostly from North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
and Georgia.</p>
<p>Wooden partitions at one time divided the lower floor into three
rooms: two tiny bedrooms and the living room. Because they made the
rooms so small, these partitions were not included when the house was
rebuilt.</p>
<p>Each room had its own fireplace. The large one was used for cooking
and for heating the combination kitchen and living room. The two
smaller fireplaces were in the bedrooms. They were connected to a
single chimney and have been omitted.</p>
<p>The large fireplace was the center of activity for the household. Every
morning a large log would be brought in and placed on the embers left
from the fire of the night before. This log would be big enough to last
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the day, and smaller sticks and logs would be put in front of it. If no
coals survived from the night before, the fire had to be lighted by sparks
from flint and steel, which was always a tedious task, or coals might
be borrowed from a neighbor. This was seldom necessary because most
families took care not to let their fires go out.</p>
<p>Hinged to the side of the big fireplace was a crane with pot hooks
or &ldquo;trammels&rdquo; on which cooking utensils were hung. Its deep pit provided
storage for wood ashes so necessary to the pioneer for the making
of lye used in making soap and hominy. Nearby was the inevitable
bellows&mdash;known in those days as &ldquo;belluses&rdquo;&mdash;and the hearth brush.</p>
<p>Cooking over an open fireplace was difficult, but many housewives
became very proficient at it, and meat cooked in this way had a flavor
unexcelled by any mode of cooking today.</p>
<p>The big fireplace also had its disadvantages. With the first frost, flies
were likely to swarm down through the chimney and into the room.</p>
<p>On one side of the fireplace was a built-in cupboard where cooking
utensils and dishes were kept. The plates and bowls usually were made
of wood or pewter, and the knives, forks and spoons of horn. Also in
the cupboard might be found a bread basket, dough trough, candle-stick
molds, a bootjack, and a box of sand used to polish the pewter ware.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fireplace was a steep staircase leading to the
attic and typical of those found in small houses of the period.</p>
<p>Nearby, perhaps over the fireplace, were suspended a flint-lock musket
and powder horn. Hanging from the ceiling of the room might be a
warming pan, raccoon skins, fox pelts, slabs of bacon and venison, chains
of sausages, and strings of dried apples and red peppers. And on a convenient
shelf was the family Bible, the leather cover of which was used&mdash;without
any disrespect intended&mdash;by the man of the house for stropping
his straight-edge razor.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02b.jpg" id="ncfig4" alt="Flatboat on river" width="800" height="418" />
</div>
<p>The attic of the house was floored with rough boards but was otherwise
unfurnished. It had been used as a bedroom, and imagination can
conjure the image of a small, wide-eyed boy lying on a pallet of rustling
corn husks, listening to the wind rattle the shingles and dodging an
occasional drop of rain which seeped through. Perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t always
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
imagination when he heard the howl of wolves or the yell of a passing
Indian. A portion of the attic floor has been cut away so visitors may
see the original rafters and shingle strips.</p>

</div>
<p>About the time the Pioneer Home was built, carpenter work was
relatively expensive. Dormer windows containing 12 panes of glass cost
$12; door frames were 8c a linear foot and window frames 16c. Panel
doors were priced at 75c per panel. This partially explains why the
windows were few and small. Another reason, of course, was the difficulty
of heating the house adequately in the winter. It was also very
difficult to transport large panes of glass over rough roads from the East.</p>
<p>The house at one time had a partial basement with dirt floor, but it
had no porches. At a later date a wooden lean-to was added at the rear
but it has long since disappeared. This addition housed a bedroom and
kitchen.</p>
<p>In the yard behind the house there was probably an outdoor fire pit
with a large iron kettle suspended above it. This kettle was used for
making soap, lard, and apple butter, and on wash days for boiling
clothes. There was also a smokehouse and tobacco-drying and stripping
shed.</p>
<p>Also just outside the back door was a rough wooden water bench on
which were a wooden basin, a gourd dipper, and soap made of grease,
ashes and sand.</p>
<p>As was the practice in those days, the house was located on the bank
of a small stream, a tributary of Hole&rsquo;s Creek. Near this stream, a well
was dug and a well-sweep erected for lowering the oaken bucket into
the well.</p>
<p>This Pioneer Home was placed in Carillon Park to show the people
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
of this generation how their forefathers lived. The purpose of this book,
too, is to describe the hardships overcome by the pioneers who braved
the unknown wilderness to help carve the destiny that we, as Americans,
enjoy today.</p>
<p>Of William Morris and his wife, little is known. But much is known
of the era in which they lived.</p>
<p>Most of the early pioneers who came to the Miami Valley trekked
westward over the rough mountain trails to Pittsburgh and then sailed
down the Ohio River. A few more hardy souls came overland all the way.</p>
<p>These settlers were attracted to the Valley by descriptions of this
&ldquo;fabulous&rdquo; land where the earth needed &ldquo;only to be tickled with the hoe
to laugh with the harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trip westward was both expensive and uncomfortable. Household
goods and supplies were loaded in &ldquo;road wagons&rdquo; and the wife and children
clambered on top of the load. The man of the family and the
larger boys usually rode horses.</p>
<p>As many as six horses were used to pull the lumbering wagons over
the steep mountain trails, and often it was necessary to stop during the
ascent to rest the horses. At these times large rocks were placed behind
the wheels to keep the wagons from rolling backward. The deep mud
of the valleys was almost as difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>It was a relief indeed when the Alleghenies had been crossed and the
family safely transferred to the &ldquo;broad horn&rdquo; river boat. The journey
downstream was more serene, but was long and tiring. However, there
was always something new to be seen around the next bend of the river
and always stories to listen to ... stories of singing fish, of wild Indian
raids, and of the fine town of Losantiville, the early name for Cincinnati.
The entire journey from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati required about six
weeks. The trip from Cincinnati to Dayton was usually made by wagon,
although some boats were &ldquo;poled&rdquo; up the Miami River at a speed of
about eight miles a day.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="122" />
<p class="pcap">Essential to the pioneer of the early American frontier was a
dependable rifle to provide food and protection for his family.
This &ldquo;Kentucky Rifle,&rdquo; a muzzle loader which used percussion caps,
was fashioned about 1830 by a Pennsylvania gunsmith for Jacob
Deeds, great-grandfather of Colonel E. A. Deeds whose grandfather,
Andrew Deeds, brought it to Ohio in 1850. This rifle is a later
version of the flintlock rifle which made possible settlement of the
dark, lonely and often dangerous forests that once covered most
of Ohio. It now is mounted on the wall of the Pioneer Home.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>It was in February, 1796, that the first surveying party came to what
is now Washington Township&mdash;the township in which the old stone
house was located. That was less than a year after Daniel Cooper came
from Cincinnati and laid out the town of Dayton.</p>
<p>The surveying group was made up of Aaron Nutt, Benjamin Robbins,
and Benjamin Archer. They pitched camp near what is now Centerville,
but were quick to move a couple of miles northeast when they discovered
signs of recent occupation of the site by Indians.</p>
<p>Although there were a few Indian raids in Montgomery County during
its earliest years, most of the Indians were peaceful except when
drunk. The major losses caused by them were through thievery of
horses and other livestock.</p>
<p>The three surveyors drew cuts for choice of lands and then returned
to Kentucky. The next spring Robbins returned with his wife and children.
They built a log cabin on a half-section of land west of the site
of Centerville. Nutt and Archer returned two years later.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" id="ncfig5" alt="Sewing and Spinning" width="800" height="800" />
</div>
<p>One of the best-known early settlers was Dr. John Hole, who moved
to the area from New Jersey in 1797. He located three and a half miles
northwest of the site of Centerville on a stream which he named Silver
Creek. Because of his prominence in the community, the stream became
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
known as Hole&rsquo;s Creek, and so it is named today. Dr. Hole erected a
log cabin with a clapboard roof and a &ldquo;cat and clay chimney,&rdquo; made
of sticks and clay. He later put up two sawmills. Being the only doctor
in that part of the Valley, Dr. Hole served patients ten and twelve miles
away.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" id="ncfig6" alt="Raising a Cabin" width="800" height="499" />
</div>
<p>Washington Township was organized in 1803, the same year Ohio
became a state and two years before Dayton was incorporated. It was
named in honor of General George Washington, for many of the early
settlers were formerly Revolutionary War soldiers. In the first election
in that year the township&mdash;then considerably larger than it is now&mdash;cast
95 votes for governor.</p>
<p>The first church meeting in the area was held in 1799, but the first
church building was not occupied until four years later. It was called
the Sugar Creek Baptist Church. One of its early members and workers
was Abner Garrard, owner of the land on which the stone house later was
built. The first minister of the church was the Rev. Charles McDaniel,
who sometimes rode 30 miles to preach at some remote settlement. He
was paid only what his congregations desired to give him.</p>
<p>Because there were no traveled roads through the forests, trails leading
to the church were blazed on trees extending as far as five miles.</p>
<p>There were three small settlements in the township in those early days:
Centerville, near the center of the township; Woodburn to the northwest,
and Stringtown to the southeast.</p>
<p>No one was very rich or very poor in those days, and everyone worked.
Of all living creatures, wrote Benjamin Franklin, quoting an old Negro
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
saying, only the hog doesn&rsquo;t work: &ldquo;He eat, he drink, he walk about, he
go to sleep when he please, he live like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" id="ncfig7" alt="Schoolhouse" width="800" height="841" />
</div>
<p>It was true. The hogs roamed the forests at will, fattening on nuts,
but the horses and oxen and humans worked!</p>
<p>There was grain to be planted, but there were none except hand-wrought
plows, made from jack-oak sticks shaped and sharpened as
best they could be and more than often drawn by a team of slow-moving
oxen broken to the yoke. A few years later this primitive plow
was improved by being tipped with an iron point. The axe was often
used to break the ground for planting, and seed was dropped in by hand.
There were no barns, so the newly cut unthreshed grain was stacked
in the fields. It was threshed with flails or tramped out under animals&rsquo;
hooves. Corn was gathered, husked, and shelled by hand, and potatoes
were dug with a sturdy pointed stick.</p>
<p>The tilled land was used as much as possible. It was not unusual for
a flax patch to be sowed in March, harvested in June, and then planted
with potatoes.</p>
<p>Life in the early 1800&rsquo;s was not all work, however, and sometimes
pleasure was combined with the chores that had to be done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Erecting a cabin called for a log rolling or house raising party. The
men of the community assembled and then divided into small groups:
one group to fell the trees, another to drive the horses and drag the
logs to the site, another to shape the logs, another to saddle and notch
the corner logs and put them in place, and another to chink the cracks
between the logs. Thus, a cabin usually was erected in a single day,
and the work was accompanied by much merriment, usually ending
with a party in the new house that night.</p>
<p>Husking bees also enabled the young people to combine work with
pleasure. The work was accompanied by songs and stories, and occasional
squeals of laughter when one of the boys husked a red ear of
corn, for that entitled him to kiss the nearest girl. In the evening, supper
was served and it was followed by a dance and perhaps an opportunity
for couples to walk home by moonlight.</p>
<p>Bees or &ldquo;frolics&rdquo; also were held for reaping, sewing, quilting, flax-scutching,
and many other occasions.</p>
<p>There also was the more enjoyable work of making cider or maple
sugar, and the excitement of smoking a bee tree to obtain the honey
inside.</p>
<p>Sleighing was a popular pastime in the winter. The young people
bundled themselves in warm clothing, placed bags of hot sand at their
feet, pulled bear skin robes over their knees and then set out with many
a laugh and song. On a crisp, clear night the sleighbells and the singing
could be heard from several miles distant.</p>
<p>The biggest social events of the day were the weddings. Often they
occurred at noon, to be followed by an afternoon of merry-making, a
big supper for the whole wedding party, and a dance in the evening.
The most popular dances were jigs, four-handed reels, double shuffles,
and scamper-downs.</p>
<p>The parents often helped their children start married life by giving
them a cow, ewe, or sow, a saddle, spinning wheel, kitchen utensils, or
a feather bed.</p>

</div>
<p>A bride with an embroidered muslin gown for the wedding was considered
fortunate, indeed. Usually the women of the day wore clothing
made of &ldquo;linsey.&rdquo; This was made of linen and wool, often in plaids and
stripes. The men wore buckskin breeches, coonskin caps, and crude
leather shoes, boots, or moccasins. In summer they sometimes went barefoot,
except when they went into the forests. Men, women, boys and
girls often wore a loose outer jacket called a &ldquo;wamus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the cloth for clothing was made from flax or wool grown by
the settlers. Most of the housewives had spinning wheels, but only a few
had looms, for they were expensive and skill was required to operate
them. The weaving would be done for a fee by those who owned looms.
Walnut hulls were crushed and used for dye. Buttons were often made of
thread, and needles and pins were scarce and expensive.</p>
<p>The first store in Washington Township was established by Aaron
Nutt, Sr., in what is now Centerville. He took a flatboat load of produce
to Baltimore, sold it, and invested the money in a horse, a cart, and a
load of drygoods, which he brought overland to Ohio.</p>
<p>Cash was scarce and much of the trading was on a barter basis. To
buy items such as tea, coffee, leather, lead, powder, and iron, required
either money or certain items which were considered of cash value&mdash;linen
cloth, feathers, beeswax, and deerskins.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of prices charged in 1815: linsey $1 per
yard; cambric $2.25 per yard; darning needles 6&frac14;c each; lead pencils
31c; nutmegs 18c each; pewter dish $2.25; tea $2.50 per pound; 8-penny
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
nails 21c per pound; calico 87&frac12;c per yard; salt $13 per 100 pounds;
flour $1.50 per barrel; wheat 25c per bushel; oats 10c per bushel.</p>
<p>Because of the high prices of coffee and tea, many housewives served
&ldquo;flour chocolate,&rdquo; a beverage made from corn, wheat and rye, or tea
made from spices, sassafras or sage. The housewife had to pulverize
her own spices, powder the salt, roast and grind the coffee, and make
her own yeast and soap.</p>
<p>Although some of the non-essentials were high in price, no one lacked
for food. Nearly every household had at least one cow, some chickens,
and some pigs. In 1810, records show that beef could be bought for 3c
a pound and pork for 3&frac12;c. Chickens were worth 75c a dozen and
potatoes 25c a bushel.</p>
<p>Wild turkeys, pheasants, rabbits, squirrels, ducks, geese, and deer
abounded in the forests. There was plenty of corn for hoe cakes, hominy
and mush; beans; blackberries; grapes; nuts; honey; and maple sap
for sugar.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" id="ncfig10" alt="Pioneer home and yard" width="800" height="592" />
</div>
<p>For breakfast the man of the house might find on his table ham, eggs,
corn pone and fried potatoes, in addition to the standard dish, mush
and milk. For a variation, or if meats were not handy, hominy and
mush might be cooked in sweetened water with bear oil or grease from
fried meat added. For supper he might have wild turkey, smoked
sausage or venison, cheese, peaches or pears, and vegetables. Once a
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
week in most households the supper consisted of &ldquo;pot luck,&rdquo; made of
meat and various vegetables, cooked together in one big pot.</p>
<p>In almost every house there was a store of cider, brandy, rum or
whiskey, but the men seldom overindulged except at weddings and
funerals. It was not uncommon at such affairs for an argument to ensue
and end in a fist fight.</p>
<p>Schools followed the establishment of churches in the township. The
school building was a log cabin with a fireplace at one end, and it often
was erected in a single day. Desks were made of puncheons and seats
of flattened saplings. The children usually wrote with pens made of
goose quills, for pencils were too scarce and too expensive. Ink was made
from maple bark and copperas.</p>
<p>The school curriculum was confined to the &ldquo;three R&rsquo;s&rdquo;: reading, &rsquo;riting,
and &rsquo;rithmetic, and no high standards were required of the teachers.
More often than not, the teacher was selected because of his or her
physical inability to do other work rather than an ability to teach. Each
patron paid his proportionate share of the cost of operating the school,
even to the point of boarding the teacher for a certain length of time.
The unfortunate teacher, like the pauper, was looked upon as a person
merely to be tolerated. All that was expected of the pupils was the ability
to write legibly, to read the Bible or an almanac, and to compute the
value of a load of produce.</p>
<p>Mail deliveries in the rural areas were unknown, but a post office
was established in Dayton in 1804, and by 1810 mail was being brought
from Cincinnati by horseback once a week.</p>
<p>The township people seldom had an opportunity to see a newspaper,
and it was a treat, indeed, when a copy of &ldquo;The Ohio Watchman,&rdquo; a
12- x 20-inch paper printed in Dayton, fell into their hands. Often the
paper would be passed along from home to home many weeks after
its date of printing.</p>
<p>In these crude surroundings our forefathers lived. They built their
cabins amid mud, stumps, poison ivy, mosquitoes, rattlesnakes, wolves,
and wildcats.</p>
<p>It was in this environment that babies were born and grew to healthy
adulthood, although they entered this world without benefit of sanitary
facilities and hospitals, and often even without the presence of a doctor
or midwife.</p>
<p>To imagine that wilderness civilization&mdash;without telephones, electricity,
bathrooms, furnaces, automobiles, trains, airplanes, radio, and
television&mdash;is difficult. But it is even more difficult to comprehend that
these improvements date back only a few short years to the lifetimes
of our own grandparents.</p>
<p>But amid the physical changes, one thing has not changed: the spirit
that conquered the wilderness. Thanks to that spirit, even greater
advancements, no doubt, are ahead.</p>
<p>And through those years to come, the Pioneer Home in Carillon
Park will remain as a symbol of hardships overcome, of progress through
work, of the strength of character that has built our America.</p>

<br />EMIGRATION.</h3>
<p>As this subject seems at present to
occupy much of the public mind on
both sides of the mountains, and has
given rise to some misrepresentation
there, I send you the results of some
of my observations, with a hope that
by means of your paper, they may
find their way into some of the eastern
prints.</p>
<p>Before bringing my family to this
country, I came here and explored it.&mdash;I
came noddle filled with ideas of
roasted pigs running about ready
at every one&rsquo;s call, of pumpions
growing wild, of orchards of best
fruit in the woods, and that every
acre was sure to produce at least 100
bushels of corn; while on the other
hand, I thought the people a of
half savages, and in fact a <i>nation of
drunkards</i>. But I found on examination,
that my tavern bills were actually
higher than at the eastward,
that property was not to be acquired
without industry and good management,
here as well as there; that
though the land was rich it required
to be cleared, fenced, and tilled, before
a crop could be expected, and
that though a few acres might be
found, producing 100 bushels, yet 75
was considered great, and in fact 40
to 50, a tolerable yield.</p>
<p>I found too that any industrious
and prudent man might get rich,
that by working a little, a man might
live, and a shifty fellow not working
at all, might stay and keep drunk
half his time, which you know to
some in the &lsquo;land of steady habits,&rsquo;
affords the greatest imaginable felicity.
A man might for one days
work in the fall, get two bushels of
corn, and often more, or one of
wheat, or from 5 to 10 &amp; 15 pounds or
more of bacon or other wholesome
meat, and a little work will feed a
family at that rate. But I found
also that two many of those who
come here, bring with them the same
ideas I brought, and are of course
disappointed;&mdash;that too many of
them were instigated to remove to
this country by reasons no way connected
with building churches. The
disappointed who have not sufficient
fortitude, sink down in despair, having
spent their little all to get here,
and betake themselves to trifling in
idleness and other bad practices.
Many came here to get rid of so
much hard work and pursue their
determination so that they do no
work, or very little and thus between
the weak and the wicked we may
easily convince how a nation of
drunkards may be formed, and
happy if no worse from such materials.</p>
<p>But one fact more I will venture
to assert&mdash;that the same work will
produce the means of subsistence for
more people here then in New England,
of which the following is a
proof:&mdash;I hired men to till about
five acres of land in corn, the whole
expense of plowing, planting, hoeing,
harvesting and board, did not exceed
$15, and I had considerably more
than 200 bushels, which were worth
at the lowest calculations $50 when it
was dry and cribbed, or $40 at the
heap. I let 12 acres to a very lazy
kind of fellow, who from the best
observation I could make, did not expend
more than twenty days work
on it of this own. His wife did assist
him in planting it, sometimes set
up the corn after the plough, and
pulled a few of the large weeds out
of the hills; but there never was a
hoe in the field after the planting.
This brought in to harvest, which is....</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
